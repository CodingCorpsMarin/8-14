 
Competencies

Understand how to read Ruby documentation
Loops and iterations are closely related in Ruby, and are often used in conjunction with each other
Arrays are collections of data (strings, numbers, even other arrays and hashes)
Can be operated on just like other objects
Hashes have keys that correspond to values, like a dictionary of words and definitions
Iteration calls upon each element of the array or hash at a time
Arrays and hashes can be declared with block parameters or “do...end” syntax
When arrays/hashes contain other arrays/hashes, they are called “nested”
.each iterates over your existing data
.map iterates and puts your data into a new array or hash
.map! permanently keeps the changes you made

Applications
Understand both ways to declare iterations, block and “do...end”
Create, access, and manipulate arrays 
Iterate and manipulate arrays with .each, .map
Create, access, and manipulate hashes
Iterate and manipulate hashes with .each, .map
Navigate nested data structures and make your own. For example, design a house with all the things in it
