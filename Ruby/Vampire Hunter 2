At the beginning of your program, ask the user how many employees will be processed,
then begin the survey process for the first employee. After you print the result for that employee, start the survey over again, and repeat until all the employees have been processed.

(Hmm, doing things over and over again ... that certainly sounds like a loop, doesn't it?)


In addition to the other questions in the survey, use a loop to ask the employee to name any allergies, 
one at a time. The employee can type “done” when finished.

As long as the allergy is not “sunshine,” continue the loop for as long as is needed. 
If at any point the employee lists “sunshine” as an allergy, skip directly to the result of “Probably a vampire.”
