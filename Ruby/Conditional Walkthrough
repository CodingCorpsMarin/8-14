Let’s practice our Ruby conditionals

Declare some variables: 

Name = Louie 
Age = 27

Write a conditional verifying my Louie and printing it out

Modify this conditional to print something else if the supplied name is incorrect

Write a conditional on a hash 
Order = { :size => “medium” }

Write conditionals for a coffeemaker to make different sized coffees  (s/m/l)
Make methods for each coffee size

Example: def make_medium_coffee
		puts “making medium coffee”
	    end

Now let’s use “unless”

Declare state of name
Unless name == Louie
	Puts “Hi stranger”
End

Use “when”

Declare state name
When name == Bobby 
	Puts “that’s my purse I don’t know you”
end

When hour == 4 then “let’s go home!”
end

Make a conditional that greets me with “good morning”, “good afternoon”, “good evening”
